# Script File
The run_analysis.R file contained in this repo serves to do the following:
  - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each        measurement.
  - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  - From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with     the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
  
# Codebook
